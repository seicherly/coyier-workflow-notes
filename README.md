##Design in Photoshop

### Trick your Brain
  * Write gibberish - just get started
  * Toss down a Texture
    * subtlepatterns.com
  * Draw some shapes
    * Put in the things you know you need
      * Footer
      * Nav
  * You don't _have_ to use traditional wireframes
    * wireframe.cc

## Get to the Browser
  * You're not doing work just to do it over again
  * The doesn't have a fixed canvas
  * It's not any slower; it's usually faster
  * HTML + CSS is pretty good for design
  * Interactivity
  * Text looks better

## Working Locally
  * Developing big redesign or new feature, it's almost impossible to do live
  * As soon as you have two (or more) people, it's required
  * Version control
  * You can use preprocessors
  * Deploy at will
